## How to contribute

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under Issues

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in an issue.

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
